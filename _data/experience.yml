    During my time at Grupo Aluman I worked as part of an agile team building our own web-based ERP application (HR, CRM, Business Intelligence...).
    As the team grew exponentially over years, we've used multiple agile methodologies like
    <mark>Kanban</mark> and <mark>Scrum</mark>. I also have experience implementing different version control systems such as
    <mark>Subversion</mark> or <mark>Git</mark>.

    I was able to work on maintaining and implementing new functionalities to the core product,
    migrating it from a traditional monolithic architecture system to <mark>REST</mark> <mark>API</mark> and microservices oriented architecture.
    This has been built from scratch where I spent most of my time.
  

    Due to the product has to cover the company as a whole, I had to integrate third-party software to the existing system,
    designing and coding utilities that fitted the requirements then.

    All along my intership in Softtek I learned lots of different things. How a company works from within,
    how teams can be organized, how worked the team I was part of, company culture...
    
    I was responsible for normalize data using patterns and scripting to provide faithful data to my teammates.
